Installation For Windows:
Windows 64-bit:
    Follow the instructions here for installing MinGW-w64 and MSYS

    Then, follow the instructions here for MS Windows DLLs:

    Summarized:
    Open MSYS console, navigate to where you have GMP source extracted (e.g. /c/gmp/)

    Run:
    ./configure --prefix=/c/primebot --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --disable-static --enable-shared

    Now run:
    make -j8
    make check -j8
    make install

    From Visual Studio developer command prompt, run the following:
    lib /def:c:\gmp\.libs\libgmp-3.dll.def /machine:x64 /out:c:\primebot\lib\libgmp-3.lib

    Next, copy the libgmp-10.dll from the bin directory and put it in the same
    folder where you will run primebot.exe from.  If you get an error that 
    libgmp is missing when you run primebot, rename libgmp-10.dll to whatever
    name the error says is missing. (In my case, it was libgmp-3.dll.dll)

Windows 32-bit:
    Why are you doing this? :)
